            <h1>High level programming languages</h1>

            <p>High level programming languages are those which need to be processed by the computer before they can run. This can be compared to low-level languages, which are ready to be used directly by the architecture of the computer. High level languages need to be translated (compiled) from human to computer in order to run. This means programs written in high level languages may be less efficent than those written in low level languages.

			<p>There are still many benefits to using high level languages, however. In fact, the vast majority of programs used by consumers are written in high level languages. Developing in low level languages is relatively difficult and specialized. High level languages on the other hand are useful for programming in a human-readable, relatively natural syntax. Our brains can't easily process binary, but we are able to understand written language! Using high level languages allows programmers to think about what they want their program to actually accomplish, without having to worry about how the computer hardware processes their instructions in machine code.

			<p>Some examples of high level languages that are familiar to many people are Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Java, and Ruby among others. Basically, if you can program commands using human words, you are probably working in a high level language.</p>
