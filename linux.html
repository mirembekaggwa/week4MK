    In 1991, Linus Torvalds, then a student at the University of Helsinki, released the first version of the Linux kernel. Torvalds had been inspired by the Unix operating system, but frustrated by its high cost and limited accessibility. He set out to create a free and open-source alternative, initially as a hobby project. As the project gained traction, developers from around the world started contributing to its source code. The collaboration model, using the GNU General Public License, allowed anyone to view, modify, and distribute the source code, fostering a sense of community.

    Throughout the 1990s, Linux gained popularity among enthusiasts and developers alike. The kernel's modular design and adaptability made it suitable for various hardware platforms. The establishment of the Linux operating system was complemented by the GNU tools and utilities, forming the basis for what is commonly known as GNU/Linux. Linux distributions, or "distros," emerged, combining the Linux kernel with software packages to create complete operating systems.

    The adoption of Linux expanded beyond personal computers to servers, where its reliability and efficiency became particularly advantageous. Companies like Red Hat and SUSE developed enterprise-grade versions of Linux, providing support and services. Linux also found its way into embedded systems, mobile devices (Android is built on the Linux kernel), and supercomputers, showcasing its versatility.

    In the 21st century, Linux has become a dominant force in server environments, powering a significant portion of the internet infrastructure. The open-source nature of Linux continues to drive innovation and collaboration, making it a key player in the ever-evolving landscape of operating systems.
