            <h1>Machine Learning</h1>

            <p>Machine Learning is one of the branches of AI, or artificial intelligence. Machine learning primarily focuses and prioritizes on using data and algorithms to allow computers to behave in the same way as humans, by learning gradually over time and improving accuracy. With machine learning, computers can predict and make decisions without needing to be programmed or told by a person. With machine learning, computer algorithms can improve over time by themselves, learning and improving as they keep processing more data. Just like how humans improve in any task or skill by doing it more, computer algorithms improve as they keep processing more data repeatedly. Machine learning is the future, it makes development more automatic and efficient, having algorithms that can improve themselves without human maintenance. Machine learning will only continue to grow as we keep on advancing in AI technology.</p>
